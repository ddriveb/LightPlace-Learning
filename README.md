3D Placement Code 

## Dependency
- [DREAMPlace](https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace)

## How to Build
You need to compile in two directories: *eDensity3d* and *place2d*. Both should be compiled following the same approach as used in DREAMPlace, or by referring to the *compile.sh* file found within each directory.

## How to Run
```bash
    python Placement.py benchmarks/ispd2005Modify/adaptec1/adaptec1.aux 2
```
